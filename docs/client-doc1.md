Client project belongs to seperate directory [client](https://github.com/dooboolab/hackatalk/tree/master/client), in [github](https://github.com/dooboolab/hackatalk).


**You need to follow [react-native environment setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) and [expo installation](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation) to continue further steps.**

> We recommend to fork the `repository` first instead of cloning directly.

1. Clone the sourcecode.
2. Navigate to `/client`
   ```
   cd client
   ```
3. Copy the environment file.
   ```
   cp .config.sample.ts .config.ts
   ```
4. Install packages. We recommend using [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com) instead of `npm`.
   ```
   yarn
   ```
5. Finally run `HackaTalk` by running `yarn start`.
   ```
   yarn start
   ```
